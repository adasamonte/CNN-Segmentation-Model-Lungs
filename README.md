# CNN-Segmentation-Model-Lungs

The notebook builds and trains a deep learning model for lung segmentation in chest X-ray images. It first mounts Google Drive and sets up file paths to load datasets. Preprocessing steps are applied, including CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization), to improve image contrast and highlight lung structures. The dataset is then organized into training and validation sets. A convolutional neural network (CNN)-based segmentation model is defined, consisting of encoder and decoder layers that learn image features and reconstruct lung masks. The model is compiled with appropriate loss functions and metrics, then trained on the dataset to improve accuracy over several epochs. Finally, the trained model is evaluated on validation data, and the predicted masks are compared against the ground truth to assess performance.
